Group 4 Project 3 Proposal
Carlos Araujo, Josh Mares, Madison Hamby, and Jackie Rosales

We agreed on using the Spotify dataset for the project; we plan on inporting and cleaning up the dataset Madison found on Monday. We will also attempt in using SpotiPy, a Python library for Spotify Web API, to analyze the dataset. 

Josh is able to run the Spotify API successfully, however he did hit a dead end because the data we are able to access is song or playlist specific and cannot access data from top charts or any data directly from Spotify without violating Spotify's terms and service. He was able to use the dataset Madison found and we decided to visualize trends in the Spotify data from 2010 to 2019.

In the project we plan to provide visualizaitons for songs' categories in popularity, danceability, and beats per minute (BPM). We wanted to focus our project into a Visual Dashboard that explores this data by grouping them by genre, popularity ect. We are thinking it would be answering questions surrounding popularity and the relation between these various metrics (bpm, length, genre).
